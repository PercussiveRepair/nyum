            <ul>
            <li><code>120g/1 cup</code> flour (white or a mixture of
            white and whole wheat)</li>
            <li><code>1 tsp</code> baking powder</li>
            <li><code>1/4 tsp</code> salt</li>
            <li><code>30g/1/4 cup</code> dry milk powder</li>
            <li><code>1 tbsp</code> shortening/suet</li>
            </ul>
            <blockquote>
            <p>Make the mix at home ahead of time. Sift dry ingredients,
            and cut shortening in with a pastry cutter or two knives
            until you have a granular, corn meal-like mixture. Package
            in zip-lock freezer bags. Double bag it if you’re going to
            be on a long trip. I’ve found that you can make large
            batches at once and make enough bannock mix for a trip in
            about fifteen minutes. Just make sure you sift the dry
            ingredients well, so you don’t get leavening problems.</p>
            <p>Baking bannock is relatively simple once you get the hang
            of it. Your first ones will be dark and maybe burnt on the
            outside and gooey on the inside. Don’t despair, just pretend
            it’s a jelly donut and try again. The key is a consistent
            heat. While flames don’t indicate a bad cooking fire, red
            glowing fires from hardwood are best.</p>
            <p>Start with a small cast iron frying pan and oil it
            well.</p>
            <p>Pour some water into the bag and squoosh it around in the
            bag (squooshing is a technical term). Because the water and
            baking powder form carbon dioxide to make the bread light,
            the faster you go from mixing to skillet, the lighter your
            bannock will be. There will be lumps, of course, but we call
            them flavor bursts. I say “some water” because how much you
            add depends on the humidity and of course, personal taste.
            You don’t want it any thinner than a muffin consistency. If
            you’ve never baked a muffin, think spackle. You can
            distribute the dough with a poke of a finger or a stick or a
            spoon if you’re the civilized sort. Remember, it’s always
            easier to add water than take it out.</p>
            <p>Squeeze the mix out of the bag and onto the warmed pan
            (not scalding hot — if the oil is smoking, it’s way too
            hot). The pan can be warmed over the fire if you have a
            grate, or leaned against a few logs near the heat source. It
            shouldn’t hiss or sizzle like a pancake batter…that means
            things are too hot. Cool it off and be patient. The bread
            will start to rise slowly.</p>
            <p>Your bannock will start to look loaf-like. At this point
            you’ll want to flip your loaf. A little shake of the pan and
            flick of the wrist can turn it over, but a spatula is fair
            game too. At this point, just keep turning it. You’ll know
            when it’s done. It’ll look a lot like the picture here.</p>
            <p>If you have a lid, you can try to cook your bannock dutch
            oven-style and put coals onto your skillet lid. Otherwise,
            you can turn it over to cook the top (carefully!) or else
            when the bottom is done, prop the pan [up against a log with
            the top facing the fire. This is my favorite sort of
            “semi-reflector-oven” method] I believe it also makes a
            lighter bannock.</p>
