            <ul>
            <li><code>250g</code> plain flour</li>
            <li><code>30g</code> caster sugar</li>
            <li><code>1 tsp</code> dry yeast</li>
            <li><code>2</code> eggs</li>
            <li><code>½</code> lemon, zested</li>
            <li><code>1 tsp</code> fine sea salt</li>
            <li><code>65g</code> softened unsalted butter</li>
            </ul>
            <blockquote>
            <p>Put 75g water and all the dough ingredients, apart from the butter, into the bowl of a mixer with a beater paddle. Mix on a medium speed for 8 mins or until the dough starts coming away from the sides and forms a ball. Turn off the mixer and let the dough rest for 1 min.</p>
            <p>Start the mixer up again on a medium speed and slowly add the butter to the dough – about 25g at a time. Once it is all incorporated, mix on high speed for 5 mins until the dough is glossy, smooth and very elastic when pulled.</p>
            <p>Cover the bowl with cling film or a clean tea towel and leave to prove for about 1 hr until it has doubled in size. Knock back the dough in the bowl briefly, then re-cover and prove for another hour.</p>
            <p>Tip the dough onto a very well floured surface and knead briefly. Roll out to 1cm thickness and cut into 6cm rounds with a floured biscuit cutter.</p>
            <p>Place them on a floured baking tray, leaving plenty of room between them, as you don’t want them to stick together while they prove.</p>
            <p>Cover loosely with cling film and leave for one more hour until doubled in size. Fill your deep-fat fryer or heavy-based saucepan halfway with oil. Heat the oil to 160C.</p>
            <p>When the oil is heated, carefully slide the doughnuts from the tray using a floured pastry scraper. Taking care not to deflate them, put them into the oil. Do 2-3 per batch, depending on the size of your fryer or pan.</p>
            <p>Fry for 2 mins each side until golden brown – they puff up and float, so you may need to gently push them down after about 1 min to help them colour evenly.</p>
            <p>Remove the doughnuts from the fryer and place them on kitchen paper.</p>
            <p>Toss the doughnuts in a bowl of caster sugar while still warm. Repeat the steps until all the doughnuts are fried, but keep checking the oil temperature is correct – if it is too high, they will burn and be raw in the middle; if it is too low, the oil will be absorbed into the doughnuts and they will become greasy. Set aside to cool before filling.</p>
