category: Asian
description: Easy one dish oven baked ribs

--- 
* `4` garlic cloves
* Large knob of ginger
* `30` spare ribs
* `4 tbsp` tomato ketchup
* `4 tbsp` hoisin sauce
* `4 tbsp` granulated sugar
* `2 tbsp` dark soy sauce
* `2 tbsp` rice vinegar
* `2 tbsp` vegetable oil
* `1 tbsp` oyster sauce
* `1/2` spring onion, finely chopped, to garnish

> Preheat the oven to 180°C
>
> Finely chop the garlic and ginger and put in a deep roasting tray or big pot suitable for the oven along with the ribs and all the other ingredients. Mix everything together thoroughly, ensuring the ribs are well covered.
>
> Transfer the ribs to the oven and cook uncovered for at least 35 - 40 minutes, basting and turning the ribs every so often so they don’t burn (if they do start to ‘catch’, turn your oven down slightly). Towards the end of the cooking time the ribs will start to break up and fall apart slightly – this is a good sign, but you want to keep them as whole as possible so be careful when turning.
>
>  Sprinkle over some finely chopped spring onion to garnish.
