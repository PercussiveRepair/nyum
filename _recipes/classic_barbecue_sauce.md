--- 

* `2 tbsp` mild chili powder
* `1 tsp` ground black pepper
* `1 tsp` table salt
* `2 cups` ketchup
* `1/2 cup` yellow ballpark-style mustard
* `1/2 cup` cider vinegar
* `1/3 cup` Worcestershire sauce
* `1/4 cup` lemon juice
* `1/4 cup` dark molasses
* `1/4 to 3/4 cup` honey (see note below)
* `1 tsp` hot sauce
* `1 cup` dark brown sugar (you can use light brown sugar if that's all you have)
* `3 tbsp`s vegetable oil
* `1` medium onion, finely chopped
* `4` medium cloves of garlic, crushed or minced

> In a small bowl, mix the American chili powder, black pepper, and salt.
>
> In a large bowl, mix the ketchup, mustard, vinegar, Worcestershire, lemon juice, steak sauce, molasses, honey, hot sauce, and brown sugar. Mix them, but you don't have to mix thoroughly.
>
> Over medium heat, warm the oil in a large saucepan.
>
> Add the onions and saute until limp and translucent, about 5 minutes. Crush the garlic, add it, and cook for another minute.
>
> Add the dry spices and stir for about 2 minutes to extract their oil-soluble flavors.
>
> Add the wet ingredients. Simmer over medium heat for 15 minutes with the lid off to thicken it a bit.
>
> Taste and adjust. Add more of anything that you want a little bit at a time. It may taste a bit vinegary at first, but that will be less obvious when you use it on meat.
>
> You can use it immediately, but I think it's better when aged overnight. You can store it into clean bottles in the refrigerator for a month or two.
