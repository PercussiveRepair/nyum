* `175g` light brown sugar
* `175ml` sunflower oil
* `3 large`  eggs, lightly beaten
* `140g` grated carrot (about 3 medium)
* `100g` walnuts, chopped
* grated zest of 1 large orange
* `175g` self-raising flour
* `1 tsp` bicarbonate of soda
* `1 tsp` ground cinnamon
* `½ tsp` grated nutmeg
* `85g` soft cream cheese
* `1 tsp` orange zest
* `2 tbsp` fresh orange juice

> Heat the oven to 180C/fan160C/gas 4. Oil and line the base and sides of an 18cm square cake tin with baking parchment.
>
> Tip the sugar, oil and eggs into a large mixing bowl. Lightly mix with a wooden spoon. Stir in the grated carrots, raisins and orange rind.
>
> Sift the flour, bicarbonate of soda and spices into the bowl. Mix everything together, the mixture will be soft and almost runny.
>
> Pour the mixture into the prepared tin and bake for 40-45 minutes or until it feels firm and springy when you press it in the centre. Cool in the tin for 5 minutes, then turn it out, peel off the paper and cool on a wire rack. (You can freeze the cake at this point if you want to serve it at a later date.)
>
> Beat the frosting ingredients in a small bowl until smooth and spread over the cooled cake
