## To Roast

---

* `4 tbsp` butter, melted
* `2` onions, quartered
* `4` sprigs rosemary
* `1` sprig sage
 
> On the day you wish to serve the bird heat the oven to 220C/430F/Gas 9.
>
> Take the turkey out of the fridge and allow it to come to room temperature while the oven is heating up.
>
> Wipe the excess brine off the skin and brush with melted butter.
>
> Add rosemary and sage to the turkey's cavity.
>
> Put the onions in a large roasting tray. Put the turkey on a trivet or wire rack in the tray.
>
> Cook for 30 minutes, then reduce the temperature to 200C/400F/Gas 7.
>
> Put a square of foil over the breat of the bird to prevent dryness then put back in the oven.
>
> Don't open the oven door until the cooking time is up.
>
> After 1 1/2 hours, or when the breast temp is 70 C, remove from the oven.
>
> To test whether the turkey is cooked, insert meat thermometer into the thickest piece of thigh. It should be about 80 C.
>
> If it is not hot enough, cook it for another 20 minutes and test again. Leave the turkey to rest in a warm place, covered with a foil tent for at least 15 minutes before carving.
>
> Strain the juice from the bottom of the tin into a large jug - the fat will rise to the top, leaving the aromatic turkey and onion beneath.
>
> Skim off the fat use the juices to make a gravy or serve as it is.
