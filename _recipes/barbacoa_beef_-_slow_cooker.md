* `3` dried ancho chilies, seeded, stemmed, and torn into pieces
* `2` dried chipotle chilies, seeded, stemmed, and torn into pieces
* `3 cloves` garlic, peeled and smashed
* `2 cups` chicken broth, divided
* `1 tbsp` dried oregano
* `1 tbsp` ground cumin
* `1 tsp` ground coriander
* `1 tsp` salt
* `2 tbsp` vegetable oil
* `2kg` chuck roast
* `1` white onion, sliced
 
> Set a saute pan over medium heat and add the chilies and garlic. Toast until fragrant, about 5 minutes. Add 11/2 cups broth to the pan and turn off the heat. Let the chilies soak and the broth cool for 10 minutes. Transfer to the bowl of a blender along with the oregano, cumin, coriander, and salt. Puree.
>
> Return the pan to the stove, add 2 tbsps of vegetable oil, and set over medium-high heat. Once the oil is shimmering, place the chuck roast in the pan and sear for 1 minute on each side. Remove from pan and place in the crock of a slow cooker.
>
> Add the sliced onion to the hot pan and saute until golden, 8-10 minutes. Add the extra 1/2 cup of chicken broth to the pan and use a wooden spoon to scrape up any brown bits stuck to the bottom. Transfer the onions to the slow cooker.
>
> Pour the pureed chili pepper mixture on top of the beef and onions. Set the slow cooker to low and cook for 8-10 hours, until fork tender.
>
> Remove the beef from the cooker and shred with a fork. Skim the fat from the liquid in the slow cooker and toss the juices with the shredded meat.
