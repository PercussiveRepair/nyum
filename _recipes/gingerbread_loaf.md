> Heat oven to 350ºF/180ºC. 
>
> Prepare a 5x9 in (13x23 cm) loaf pan (or any mid-size cake pan) by either greasing the inside or lining it with parchment.
>
> Pour the milk into a microwave-safe measuring jug, along with the molasses and honey. 
>
> Drop in the butter in chunks. 
>
> Microwave until the butter chunks are halfway melted, stir, and let them keep melting while you measure out the dry ingredients.
>
> Put the flour in a mixing bowl along with the salt, baking soda and spices. Whisk to combine the drys and to fluff up the flour.
>
> The butter should be melted now — put the sugar in with the wet ingredients
>
> Follow with the egg and whisk a bit until smooth. 
>
> Pour the wet mixture into the dry and whisk until just smooth.
>
> Pour into the tin and bake for about an hour until done inside. The top usually looks slightly raw  and shiny when the inside is perfect.
>
> Allow to cool and then slice. 
>
> Keeps for several days and gets better as it goes.
