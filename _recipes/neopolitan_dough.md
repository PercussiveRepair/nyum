* `500g` Tipo 00 flour
* `325g` water (65% hydration)
* `10g` salt
* `3g` active dry yeast

> Mix the dough in a stand mixer, slowly for two minutes, faster for 5 minutes, and slow again for 2 minutes.
>
> Cover the dough and let it rise for 1½ – 2 hours, or until double. Punch it down and push out the air bubbles. Form the dough into a large ball, then cut it into three 275gr equal pieces.
>
> Shape each piece of dough into a smooth ball with a tight outer “skin.” Set your ball seam-side down where it can rest. Dust your pizza balls with flour, and store them under a damp towel, in a proofing tray, or under plastic wrap. This will prevent the outside of the ball from drying out and creating a crust, and becoming difficult to work with. The top of the pizza ball should be soft and silky.
>
> Your pizza balls will need to rest for about an hour to become soft and elastic so that they can be easily stretched into a thin crust pizza.
>
> If you won’t need your dough for more than an hour, refrigerate it until you are ready to start.
