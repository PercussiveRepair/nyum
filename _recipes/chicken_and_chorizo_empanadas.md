## For the chicken

---

* `4` chicken thighs, on the bone and skin on

> Heat your oven to 180°C/gas 4. , put the chicken thighs in a small roasting dish, season well all over with salt and pepper and roast for about 45 minutes until cooked through.
>
> Set aside to cool a little.

## For the pastry

---

* `150g` unsalted butter
* `300g` plain flour
* Large pinch of fine salt
* `1 medium` egg. lightly beaten
* `3 to 5 tbsp` water

> Melt the butter and leave it to cool slightly. Put the flour into a large bowl and mix in the salt. Pour in the butter and egg. Start mixing, adding the water as you go, until you have a soft dough. Turn out onto your work surface and knead gently for a couple of minutes, until smooth. Return the dough to its bowl, cover and set aside to rest while you prepare the filling.

## For the filling

---

* `1 tbsp` olive oil
* `1 medium` onion, finely chopped
* `1 clove` garlic, crushed
* `100g` cured chorizo sausage (ready-to-eat), finely diced
* `1/2 tsp` cumin seeds
* `50g` raisins
* Salt and pepper

> Heat the olive oil in a frying pan over a medium-low heat Add the onion and cook for 10-12 minutes, until soft Add the garlic, chorizo, cumin seeds and raisins. Cook over a medium heat for 5-8 minutes, stirring often, until the chorizo is cooked. Remove from the heat.
>
> Once the chicken thighs are cool enough to handle, remove the skin. Pull all the meat from the bones and chop it roughly. Add to the chorizo mixture. Taste and add salt and pepper if needed (the chorizo is already quite salty), then leave to cool completely.

## To make empanadas

---

* `1` egg, beaten, to glaze

> Turn the oven up to 200°C/gas 6 and line a large baking sheet with baking parchment.
>
> Lightly flour your work surface and roll out the dough to a 3-4mm thickness. Using a 12cm cutter, or a small bowl as a guide, cut out 10 discs. You will probably need to re-roll the offcuts once to get this many. Divide the filling between the discs. Dampen the edges of the dough with water, then fold over one half of each disc to make a semi-circular parcel. Press the edges together firmly, then crimp or press the edges with a fork.
>
> Put the empanadas on the baking sheet and brush with beaten egg
>
> Bake for 15-20 minutes, until golden. Eat them warm, on their own or with a chilli sauce.
