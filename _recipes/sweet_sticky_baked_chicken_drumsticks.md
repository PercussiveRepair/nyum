category: Roasts

--- 
* `¼ cup` balsamic vinegar
* `¼ cup` honey
* `¼ cup` light brown sugar, packed
* `2 tbsp` low-sodium soy sauce
* `3 cloves` garlic, minced
* `1 tbsp` minced fresh ginger
* `½ tsp` fresh cracked black pepper
* `6` chicken drumsticks, about 750g
* `1 tbsp` sesame seeds, lightly toasted
* `2 tsp` chopped fresh parsley
 
> In a medium bowl, whisk together balsamic vinegar, honey, brown sugar, soy sauce, garlic, ginger and cracked black pepper. Pour into a large ziplock bag and add chicken drumsticks. Shake to coat chicken and refrigerate for 8 hours, or overnight, giving the bag a shake whenever you think about it.
>
> Preheat oven to 400°F/200°C. Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil and place a Cooling Rack on top.
>
> Remove the chicken from the bag, reserving the marinade, and place the drumsticks on the rack. Bake the drumsticks, on the middle oven rack, for 25 minutes.
>
> While the chicken is baking, place the leftover marinade in a small saucepan. Bring the marinade to a boil, then reduce the heat to a slow simmer. Cook over low heat, stirring as needed, for about 15 minutes or until thickened.
>
> Remove drumsticks from oven (after first 25 minutes of cooking) and heavily coat with the thickened marinade, using a silicone pastry brush. Return to the oven and cook for 10 more minutes. Coat the drumsticks again and return to oven to cook for 5 more minutes, or until an internal temperate of 160°F is reached.
>
> Coat the drumsticks one last time, with any remaining sauce, and sprinkle with sesame seeds and parsley. Serve immediately.
