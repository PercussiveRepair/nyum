category: Sides
veggie: y

--- 
* `1` lemon
* `2 tbsp` extra virgin olive oil
* sea salt
* freshly ground black pepper
* `500g` spring greens
 
> Using a microplane, finely grate the lemon zest onto a chopping board, then transfer to a jam jar
>
> Cut the lemon in half.
>
> Squeeze the juice into the jar, using your fingers to catch any pips (keep the remaining lemon for another recipe).
>
> Add the extra virgin olive oil to the jar with a tiny pinch of salt and pepper.
>
> Put the lid securely on the jar and shake well.
>
> Have a taste and see whether you think it needs a bit more lemon juice or oil – you want it to be slightly too acidic, so that it’s still nice and zingy once you’ve dressed your spring greens.
>
> Trim and cut the spring greens in half lengthways, then finely slice them.
>
> Steam for 3 to 4 minutes or until tender but still bright green in colour.
>
> Once cooked, drain over the sink into a colander, steam dry for a minute, then tip back into the pan.
>
> Give the dressing another good shake up, then drizzle it over.
>
> Using tongs, gently toss in the dressing while they’re still hot to help them soak up all the dressing, then transfer to a bowl and serve straight away.
