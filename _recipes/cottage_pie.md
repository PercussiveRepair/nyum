## For the mince

---

* `3 tbsp` olive oil
* `1¼kg` beef mince
* `2` onions, finely chopped
* `3` carrots, chopped
* `3 sticks` celery, chopped
* `2 cloves` garlic cloves, finely chopped
* `3 tbsp` plain flour
* `1 tbsp` tomato purée
* `80ml` red wine or port (optional)
* `850ml` beef stock
* `4 tbsp` Worcestershire sauce
* `1 small sprig` thyme sprigs
* `2` bay leaves

> Heat 1 tbsp olive oil in a large saucepan and fry 1¼kg beef mince until browned – you may need to do this in batches. Set aside as it browns.
>
> Put the other 2 tbsp olive oil into the pan, add 2 finely chopped onions, 3 chopped carrots and 3 chopped celery sticks and cook on a gentle heat until soft, about 20 mins.
>
> Add 2 finely chopped garlic cloves, 3 tbsp plain flour and 1 tbsp tomato purée, increase the heat and cook for a few mins, then return the beef to the pan.
>
> Pour over a large glass of red wine, if using, and boil to reduce it slightly before adding the 850ml beef stock, 4 tbsp Worcestershire sauce, a few thyme sprigs and 2 bay leaves.
>
> Bring to a simmer and cook, uncovered, for 45 mins. By this time the gravy should be thick and coating the meat. Check after about 30 mins – if a lot of liquid remains, increase the heat slightly to reduce the gravy a little. >
>
> Season well, then discard the bay leaves and thyme stalks.

## For the mash

---

* `1.8kg` potatoes, chopped
* `225ml` milk
* `25g` butter
* `200g` strong cheddar, grated
* freshly grated nutmeg

> Meanwhile, make the mash. In a large saucepan, cover the 1.8kg potatoes which you've peeled and chopped, in salted cold water, bring to the boil and simmer until tender.
>
> Drain well, then allow to steam-dry for a few mins. Mash well with the 225ml milk, 25g butter, and three-quarters of the 200g strong cheddar cheese, then season with freshly grated nutmeg and some salt and pepper.
>
> Spoon the meat into 2 ovenproof dishes. Pipe or spoon on the mash to cover. Sprinkle on the remaining cheese.
>
> If eating straight away, heat oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7 and cook for 25-30 mins, or until the topping is golden.
