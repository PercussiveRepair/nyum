* `500g` all-purpose flour (use bread flour if you want chewier buns)
* `300ml` warm milk
* `7g` active dry yeast
* `1 tbsp` white sugar
* `1/2 tbsp` kosher salt (up to 1 tbsp for a saltier version)
* `75g` butter, melted
* Milk for wash
 
> Combine all ingredients except yeast in the bowl of a stand mixer fitter with a dough hook. Mix the ingredients on low speed for about 1 minute, until the ingredients are somewhat mixed together. I add yeast later as melted butter and warmed up milk can be too warm for the yeast. Once mixed with the flour, salt and sugar, the temperature will drop and be fine for the yeast. Add the yeast and mix on medium speed for about 10 minutes, until the dough gathered into a ball and is soft and silky smooth. If doing by hand, follow the same sequence and knead in the bowl for about 10 minutes or so.
>
> Cover the bowl with a plastic wrap and let rise in warm place for about 1 hour and a half, until the dough about doubled in size.
>
> Cut the dough into 8 pieces about 80g each and form balls. Place the balls seam side down on a parchment paper lined baking sheet and cover with plastic to prevent drying. Let proof for about 30 minutes in a warm room. The balls will increase in size by about 50% or so. If not, let them proof longer.
>
> Preheat the oven to 180C fan/200C
>
> Remove the plastic wrap, score the buns, if desired, brush the milk over each bun, sprinkle sesame seeds and/or poppy seeds.
>
> Bake for about 30 minutes, until the tops a deep golden brown.
