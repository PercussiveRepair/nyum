## For the dough

---

* `280g` plain flour
* `7g` baking powder
* `small pinch` cream of tartar
* `7g` dry yeast
* `70g` sugar
* `125g` tepid water
* `1 tbsp` lard, melted and cooled slightly

> Mix the ingredients for the dough, except the lard, in the bowl of a stand mixer
>
> Mix on medium for 10 minutes. The dough should come together and be soft, smooth and a little sticky
>
> Add the lard and mix for another 5 mins
>
> Cover the dough in the mixing bowl and rest for 15 mins
>
> Turn the dough out into a flour dusted board and roll out to a large rectangle. Fold in half lengthwise and roll again. Repeat one more time and then roll up the dough into a long sausage from the long edge
>
> Divide the dough into 12 equal pieces about 45g each and, one at a time, roll into a circle using the dumpling method of rolling to the centre then quarter-turn. The dough should be thinner at the edges and plump in the centre. Do not use extra flour if possible when rolling the circles as the edges will not stick

## To make bao

--- 

> Spoon one tablespoon of the prepared pork filling into the centre of the dough. Gather up the edges and press to seal in three.

> Place the bun seam side up on a square of oiled baking parchment or wax paper
>
> Allow buns to proof on the counter, covered, for 1 hour
>
> Prepare a steamer, I use a bamboo steamer set on a wok, with gently boiling water
>
> Once the buns have proofed gently place them, at least 1 inch apart, in the basket of your steamer. Cover and allow to steam for ten minutes. Do not let the water boil too vigorously
>
> After ten minutes carefully remove the lid, making sure not to drip water on the buns, and remove to a plate. Cover with a towel until ready to eat. Steam the remaining buns
>
> Peel the paper off the buns and serve warm
