>
> Oil your bowl and place in the dough, covered for 30 mins at room temp
>
> Tip out your dough gently and cut and shape into large softball sized pieces approx 150g keeping the dough tight. Should make about 10 dough balls
>
> Dust a large baking tray with semolina or cornmeal and place in the dough balls about 5cm apart
>
> Dab the top of each ball with olive oil and cover tightly with plastic wrap. Leave to rest for 2 hours at room temp

## For the pizza 

---

* `2 cups` passata or 1 can of blitzed plum tomatoes
* `1 tsp` salt
* `1 tsp` olive oil
* Fresh mozzarella
* Fresh basil
* Other toppings e.g. olives, salami, prosciutto, 
* `1/2 cup` of semolina or cornmeal
 
> Put pizza stone in the oven at max temp for 1 hour
>
> Make the sauce by mixing the passata or blitzed tomatoes with 5-6 torn basil leaves, the salt and olive oil
>
> If using fresh ball mozzarella, chop into 1cm cubes
>
> Fill a large shallow bowl with 1/2 cup of semolina or cornmeal 
>
> Dust the dough ball in the tray and your scraper with semolina or cornmeal and scrape the dough ball off the tray in one go
>
> Place the dough ball face down in the semolina/cornmeal bowl and dust well
>
> With a little semolina or cornmeal on the work surface, place the dough ball face up again and use the press and stretch method to make a circle about 10-12 inches across. https://youtu.be/G-jPoROGHGE?t935
>
> Once stretched, place on a cornmeal dusted pizza peel, dab the crust with olive oil, dress with sauce and cook on the stone in the oven for about 8 mins or until just baked
>
> Remove, add cheese and other toppings and place back in the oven until fully baked, about 5 mins
 Freezing left over dough balls 
>
> Seal the dough balls in the flour dusted tray again with plastic wrap
>
> Place in the freezer overnight to freeze completely
>
> Remove from the tray and place in individual zip lock bags in the freezer

## Defrosting 

---

> The night before, take out as many dough balls as you want to make pizzas
>
> Place in a high sided, cornmeal dusted tray, dust a little flour on top and seal with plastic wrap
>
> Place in the fridge overnight
>
> 1 hour before using, remove from the fridge
>
> Dough will be very soft so will need less stretching
