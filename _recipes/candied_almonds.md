* `110g` caster sugar
* `70ml` water
* `170g` raw whole almonds
* dash salt (optional)
* `1/2 tsp` ground cinnamon (optional)
 
> Heat a large frying pan over a low to medium heat.
>
> Pour the water into the pan and stir in the powdered sugar until the sugar is completely absorbed. 
>
> When the sugar reaches 125 C and has large, slow popping bubbles, reduce the heat to low
>
> Add the salt, cinnamon (optional) and almonds and stir until coated
>
> The liquid will crystallise around the almonds and turn sandy. Keep stirring. 
>
> Turn the heat back to medium. The sugar will eventually re-melt and turn to caramel.
>
> Tip the almonds out of the pan onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper to cool.
