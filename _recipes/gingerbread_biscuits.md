--- 
* `340g` plain flour
* `1 tsp` baking powder
* `1/2 tsp` salt
* `1 1/2 tsp` grated nutmeg
* `1 1/2 tsp` ground cloves
* `2 tsp` ground cinnamon
* `3 tsp` ground ginger
* `225g` unsalted butter, softened
* `340g` soft brown sugar
* `1` egg, beaten
* `75g` crystallised ginger, finely chopped
 
> Sift the flour, baking powder, salt and spices together into a mixing bowl.
>
> Beat together the butter and sugar, and then add the egg, beating it in gradually, so the mixture doesn't curdle. Stir into the flour to make a dough, and then mix in the crystallised ginger.
>
> Put the dough between two sheets of clingfilm, and roll out to the thickness of a Â£1 coin. Refrigerate for half an hour. Pre-heat the oven to 180C.
>
> Cut out the biscuits, and put on a greased baking tray. Cook for about 10 minutes, and, when straight out of the oven, poke a hole in each and allow to cool on a rack before threading a ribbon through.
>
> Decorate with writing icing, or sift the icing sugar, and then mix to a stiff consistency with boiling water. Brush over the cooled biscuits, and decorate with hundreds and thousands while still wet.
