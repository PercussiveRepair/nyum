* `2 medium` yellow onions, thinly sliced
* `4 medium` garlic cloves, thinly sliced
* `1 cup` chicken stock or low-sodium chicken broth
* `1 tbsp` packed dark brown sugar
* `1/2 tsp` chilli powder
* `2 tsp` kosher salt, plus more as needed
* `2 tsp` ground black or white pepper
* `1 tsp` paprika
* `1 tsp` thyme
* `2-2.5kg` boneless or bone-in pork shoulder (also known as pork butt), twine or netting removed
* `2/3 cup` ketchup
* `few drops` liquid smoke (optional)
 
> Place the onions and garlic in an even layer in the slow cooker. Pour in the stock or broth and liquid smoke.
>
> Combine the sugar and spices in a small bowl. 
>
> Pat the pork dry with paper towels. Rub the spice mixture all over the pork and place the meat on top of the onions and garlic. 
>
> Cover and cook until the pork is fork tender, about 6 to 8 hours on high or 8 to 10 hours on low.
>
> Turn off the slow cooker and remove the pork to a cutting board. 
>
> Set a fine-mesh strainer over a medium heatproof bowl. Pour the onion mixture from the slow cooker through a sieve into a pan and add the ketchup. Return the solids to the slow cooker.
>
> Set the strained liquid on a high heat to reduce.
>
> If the pork has a bone, remove and discard it. Using 2 forks, shred the meat into bite-sized pieces, discarding any large pieces of fat. Return the shredded meat to the slow cooker.
>
> Over a high heat, reduce the sauce in the pan to the desired consistency.
>
> Spoon enough sauce over the pork to just moisten it and mix with the onion mixture.
>
> Serve with warm rolls
