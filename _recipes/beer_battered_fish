--- 
* 120-140g pieces of firm white fish. Cod or haddock work well.
* `150g` plain flour
* `150g` rice flour or cornflour
* `1/4 tsp` baking soda or baking powder
* `1/4 tsp` salt
* `300ml` good fizzy beer like Heineken
* Oil for deep frying
 
> Season both sides of the fish with salt. Set aside for 10min. 

## For the beer batter

---

> Add 100g flour, 100g rice flour, baking soda or powder and salt to a bowl and mix.
> 
> Whisk in most of the beer.  Consistency should be pretty thin, like melted ice cream. 
> 
> Refrigerate batter for about 10min while you do the next two steps. 

## To Fry

---

> Add 4cm of oil to a large heavy bottomed pot and heat over medium until temp reaches 190C.
> 
> For the dredge, mix together the remaining 50g flour and 50g rice flour. 
> 
> Dry the fish well then dredge fish in the flour mixture. 
> 
> Remove batter from fridge and check consistency. If it’s a lot thicker than melted ice cream, add additional beer to thin. 
> 
> Place pieces of fish in cooled batter to cover on all sides, then allow excess batter to drain off. 
> 
> Drop in pieces of fish very slowly and place down away from you. 
> 
> Cook for 2.5 to 5 mins until golden brown, flipping over halfway through. Don’t fry more than about 3 pieces of fish at once to avoid cooling oil. 
> 
> Remove from oil and place on a paper towel or wire rack to drain.
