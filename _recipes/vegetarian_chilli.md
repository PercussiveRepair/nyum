* `1 medium` red onion, chopped
* `1 large` red bell pepper, chopped
* `2 medium` carrots, chopped
* `2 ribs` celery, chopped
* `½ tsp` salt, divided
* `4 cloves` garlic, pressed or minced
* `1` mild red chili pepper, finely diced
* `1 tsp` chipotle paste
* `2 tsp` chili powder
* `3 tsp` ground cumin
* `3 tsp`s smoked paprika
* `2 tsp` dried oregano
* `2 cans` diced tomatoes and juice
* `3 cans` either black, pinto or other beans, drained
* `500ml` vegetable broth or water
* `1` bay leaf
* `2 tbsp` chopped fresh corander leaf, plus more for garnish
* `2 tsp` lime juice, or to taste

> In a large Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat, warm 2 tbsps of olive oil until shimmering. Add the chopped onion, bell pepper, carrot, celery and ¼ teaspoon of the salt. Stir to combine and cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are tender and the onion is translucent, about 7 to 10 minutes.
>
> Add the garlic, fresh chili, chipotle paste, chili powder, cumin, smoked paprika and oregano. Cook until fragrant while stirring constantly, about 1 minute.
>
> Add the diced tomatoes and their juices, the drained beans, vegetable broth and bay leaf. Stir to combine and let the mixture come to a simmer. Continue cooking, stirring occasionally and reducing heat as necessary to maintain a gentle simmer, for 1 hour.
>
> Remove the chili from the heat and discard the bay leaf. For the best texture and flavor, blend the chili briefly with an immersion blender, or mash the chili with a potato masher until it reaches a thicker, more chili-like consistency.
>
> Add the chopped cilantro, stir to combine, and then mix in the lime juice and salt to taste. Divide the mixture into individual bowls and serve with garnishes of your choice. This chili will keep well in the refrigerator for about 4 days or you can freeze it for longer-term storage
