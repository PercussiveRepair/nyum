## For the dough

---

* `2 1/4 cups` all purpose flour, plus extra for dusting
* `1 tsp` salt
* `1 large`  egg, beaten
* `1 cup` sour cream
* `55g` butter, softened

> In a large bowl, combine the flour and salt. Add in the beaten egg, sour cream, and softened butter.
>
> Mix for about 5 minutes, or until the ingredients are evenly distributed and the dough pulls away from the bowl. If your dough is still very sticky, add a bit more flour, and if it's too dry, add a bit more sour cream. Remember, flour measurements by cups vary, so sometimes you may have to tweak your doughs to the right consistency.
>
> Wrap the finished dough in plastic wrap and set in the refrigerator. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, or up to 48 hours.

## For the filling

---

* `5` red potatoes, skinned and boiled
* `500g` bacon
* `1 large`  onion, chopped
* `1 cup` cheddar cheese, shredded
* Salt and pepper, to taste

> Cook the bacon in a large skillet, crumble, and set aside. Add the onion, season with salt and pepper, and saute over medium in the bacon fat until soft and brown, stirring occasionally, about 30 minutes.
>
> Smash the boiled potatoes in a large bowl and add in the crumbled bacon, cheddar cheese, and the caramelized onions. Add salt and pepper, and taste test the mixture. Add more salt and pepper, if necessary.
>
> Roll the filling into 1" balls.

## To make the dumplings

---

> Remove the dough from the refrigerator, and roll out on a floured surface to about 1/8 inch thick.
>
> Using a circular cookie cutter or the top of a glass, cut the dough into circles.
>
> Place one ball of filling on each cut out and fold the dough into a semi circle around it.
>
> Using the tines of a fork, press together the edges of the dough to seal it together.

## To cook

---

> Bring a large pot of water to a boil and add the pierogi.
>
> Boil them until they float to the top.
>
> Remove them from the water with a slotted spoon and let dry.
>
> Heat the remaining onion/bacon juices in the original pan.
>
> Add butter if necessary. Add a few pierogi to the pan at a time and fry until crisp.
>
> Serve with sour cream.
