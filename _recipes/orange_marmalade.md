--- 
* `4` large seedless oranges
* `2` lemons
* `8` cups sugar
 
> Cut the oranges and lemons in half crosswise, then into very thin half-moon slices. (If you have a mandoline, this will be quite fast.) Discard any seeds.
>
> Place the sliced fruit and their juices into a stainless-steel pot. Add 8 cups water and bring the mixture to a boil, stirring often. Remove from the heat and stir in the sugar until it dissolves. Cover and allow to stand overnight at room temperature.
>
> The next day, bring the mixture back to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer uncovered for about 2 hours.
>
> Turn the heat up to medium and boil gently, stirring often, for another 30 minutes. Skim off any foam that forms on the top.
>
> Cook the marmalade until it reaches 220 degrees F on a candy thermometer.
>
> If you want to be doubly sure it's ready, place a small amount on a plate and refrigerate it until it's cool but not cold. If it's firm -- neither runny nor too hard -- it's done. It will be a golden orange color. (If the marmalade is runny, continue cooking it and if it's too hard, add more water.)
>
> Pour the marmalade into clean, hot Mason jars; wipe the rims thoroughly with a clean damp paper towel, and seal with the lids. Store in the pantry for up to a year.
