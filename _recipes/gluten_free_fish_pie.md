## For the mash

* `4` potatoes
* `2 tbsp` butter / dairy free spread
* `dash` milk

* salt and pepper


> Preheat your oven to 160C.
> 
> Peel, chop & boil the potatoes for 15 - 20 minutes, until cooked and ready to mash.
> 
> Mash your potatoes with a little milk, butter (dairy free spread is fine), mustard, salt and pepper. Put your mashed potato to one side till later.


## For the Fish

---

* `400-500g` fish pie mix (haddock, salmon and cod)
* `8-10` raw king prawns
* `50g` smoked salmon

> Place your fish into the dish you are going to make the fish pie in. 
>
> Pour over your milk and place in the oven for about 10 minutes to gently poach and fill the milk with flavour.
> 
> Once done, remove the fish from dish and put to one side. The milk will now be needed to make a white sauce.

## For the sauce

---

* `350ml` milk
* `25g` gluten free plain flour
* `25g` butter / dairy free spread
* salt and pepper
* `2tbsp` of freshly chopped chives or dried parsley

>
> On a low/medium heat, keep stirring your mixture until it thickens. 
>

## Assemble & bake

---

* `1 cup` grated cheese, for topping

> Increase the oven temperature to 180C.
>
> Return your fish to your oven proof dish. Mix it up a little so there will be different fish flavours in every mouthful. Add the raw king prawns (frozen or fresh) and the slices of smoked salmon.
>
> Pour over your white sauce.
>
> Spoon your mash over the top making sure it's sealed at the edges.
>
> Sprinkle some grated cheese on top. 
> 
> Cook in the oven for about 25 minutes at an increased temperature of 180C, until the top starts to go golden. Place the dish on a baking sheet incase the fish pie bubbles over.
