* `500g` bread flour or all purpose flour or 35g wheat gluten and 465g of plain flour
* `5g` yeast
* `15g` salt
* `350g` hand hot (not boiling - max 40degC) water
* about 2 Tablespoons extra flour for shaping

>>> To scale up the ratio is: 100 parts flour, 1.5 parts salt, 1 part instant yeast, and 70 parts water.

> Combine flour, yeast and salt in a large bowl. Stir in water until itâ€™s well combined and dough is shaggy.
>
> Cover with plastic wrap and let stand at room temperature for 3 hours.
>
> After 3 hours dough will become puffy and dotted with bubbles. Transfer it to a well-floured surface and sprinkle dough with a little flour. Using a scraper fold dough over 10-12 times & shape into a rough ball.
>
> Place in a parchment paper-lined bowl (not wax paper) and cover with a towel. Let stand on counter top for about 35 minutes.
>
> Meantime place Dutch oven with lid in a cold oven and preheat to 220degC
>
> When oven reaches temp carefully, using oven gloves, lift the parchment paper and dough from the bowl and place gently into the hot pot. (parchment paper goes in the pot too) Cover and bake for 30 minutes.
>
> After 30 minutes, remove lid and parchment paper. Return, uncovered, to oven and bake 10 - 15 more minutes. Let it cool at least 15 minutes before slicing.
