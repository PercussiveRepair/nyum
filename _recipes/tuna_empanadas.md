## To make empanadas

---

* `1` egg, beaten, to glaze

> Turn the oven up to 200°C/gas 6 and line a large baking sheet with baking parchment.
>
> Lightly flour your work surface and roll out the dough to a 3-4mm thickness. Using a 12cm cutter, or a small bowl as a guide, cut out 6-8 discs. You will probably need to re-roll the offcuts once to get this many. 
> 
> Divide the filling between the discs. 
> 
> Dampen the edges of the dough with water, then fold over one half of each disc to make a semi-circular parcel. Press the edges together firmly, then crimp or press the edges with a fork.
>
> Put the empanadas on the baking sheet and brush with beaten egg
>
> Bake for 15-20 minutes, until golden. 
> 
> Eat warm.
