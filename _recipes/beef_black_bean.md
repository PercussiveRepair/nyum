## For velveting the beef

---

* `500g` beef flank steak or beef chuck (thinly sliced against the grain)
* `1 tsp` baking soda
* `60ml` water
* `2 tsp` cornstarch
* `2 tsp` vegetable oil
* `2 tsp` oyster sauce
* `1 tsp` Shaoxing wine

> In a medium bowl, add the beef, baking soda, and water. Massage the beef with your hands until most of the liquid is absorbed. 
>
> Let stand for 1 to 2 hours (less time for more tender beef, or longer for a tougher cut like chuck). 
> 
> Then rinse the beef thoroughly under running water until the water runs clear. Drain. This step tenderizes the meat before marinating.
>
> Then add the cornstarch, vegetable oil, oyster sauce, and Shaoxing wine. 
>
> Mix well and marinate the beef for at least 30 minutes, or even overnight if you’d like to make this ahead.

## For the sauce

--- 
* `1 1/2 cups low sodium beef or chicken stock
* `2 tbsp` black bean and garlic sauce (such as Lee Kum Kee)
* `1 tbsp` oyster sauce
* `1/2 tsp` sugar
* `1/2 tsp` dark soy sauce
* `1/2 tsp` sesame oil
* `1/8 tsp` ground white pepper (or to taste)

> In a bowl, mix together the stock, black bean garlic sauce, oyster sauce, dark soy sauce, sesame oil, sugar, and white pepper, and set aside.

## To cook

---

* `3 tbsp` vegetable oil
* `2/3 cup` onion (cut into 1-inch/2.5cm pieces)
* `1 cup` red bell pepper (cut into 1-inch/2.5cm pieces)
* `1 tbsp` Shaoxing wine
* `1 cup` snow peas, broccoli or other green veg
* `1 1/2 tbsp` cornstarch (mixed into a slurry with 2 tbsp water)

> Heat your wok over high heat until it starts to smoke lightly. Turn off the heat and add 2 tbsp of oil around the perimeter of the wok.
> 
> Place back on hig heat and add the beef in 1 layer, and sear the beef on both sides until browned (this should only take 2-3 minutes). Remove the beef from the wok, and set aside.
>
> Reduce the heat to medium-high, and add the remaining 1 tbsp of oil, onions, and bell peppers. Stir-fry for 30 seconds, until the onions and peppers have very light sear on them. Next, add the Shaoxing wine to deglaze the wok.
>
> Stir in the sauce mixture you made earlier. Bring to a simmer, and add the beef (along with any juices) back to the wok. Stir it in, then add the snow peas, brocoli or other veg.
> 
> Bring the contents of the wok to a simmer. Stir the cornstarch and water until incorporated into a slurry, and gradually add the slurry to the sauce, stirring constantly until the sauce is thickened to your liking (if it’s too thick, add a splash of water or stock; if it's too thin, add more slurry). Cook until the veg is just crisp-tender. Serve immediately with steamed rice!
