--- 
* `2 tbsp` vegetable oil
* `1` onion, finely chopped
* `2 medium` leeks, washed, trimmed and thickly sliced
* `750g` chicken, cut into bite-size pieces
* `3` smoked bacon rashers, chopped
* `1 clove` garlic, crushed
* `1/2 tsp` thyme
* `2` bay leaves
* `150 ml` chicken stock, hot
* `142 ml` cream
* `375g` pack ready-rolled pastry
* `1 medium` egg
 
> Heat the oil in a large frying pan over a medium heat.
>
> Add the onion and leeks and cook for 4-5 minutes until softened.
>
> Add the chicken pieces and bacon and cook, stirring, for another 4-5 minutes.
>
> Stir in the garlic. Pour in the stock and simmer until reduced by half. Add the thyme, bay leaves and cream, bring to the boil, then simmer for 5-6 minutes until thickened.
>
> Season, then spoon into a 2.5-litre pie dish (or 4 x 300ml ovenproof dishes). Set aside to cool.
>
> Brush a little water along the edge of the pie dish or dishes. Unroll the pastry and cut out a piece large enough to cover the dish or dishes. Press down the edges and trim off the excess. Snip a small hole in the centre of the pastry to let the steam escape. Put on a baking tray and chill for 15 minutes.
>
> Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 220Â°C/fan200Â°C/gas 7.
>
> Beat the egg with a little salt, then brush over the pastry. Bake for 40-45 minutes (20-25 minutes if you are making individual pies) until the pastry is golden.
